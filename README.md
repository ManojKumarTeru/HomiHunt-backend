- CRUD Operations for Property Listings
- Advanced Filtering (Location, Price, Bedrooms, etc.)
- Favorite a Property
- Redis Caching
- Recommend a Property to Another User
- Deployed on Render

## Tech Stack

- **Backend**: Node.js, Express, TypeScript
- **Database**: MongoDB
- **Cache**: Redis
- **Authentication**: JWT + Bcrypt
- **Deployment**: Render



## Project Setup

- Configured TypeScript with `tsconfig.json` for ES6 target and CommonJS modules.
- Set up Express server with necessary middleware.
- Configured MongoDB connection using Mongoose.
- Organized project files inside the `src/` folder for clear structure.
- Integrated `nodemon` for hot-reloading during development.

## Importing CSV into MongoDB

- Downloaded the dataset CSV file from the provided source.
- Created a standalone script (`importCsv.ts`) to read the CSV file using `csv-parser`.
- Parsed CSV data and transformed fields as necessary (e.g., string `"True"` to Boolean `true`).
- Inserted the processed data into MongoDB collection using Mongoose models.
- Script is designed to be run **once** to seed initial data into the database.
